## The right space for the right Moment

The loft is a converted artist's atelier in Paris, part of a group of buildings around a lovely garden. It combines the romance of being in Paris, with the vibe of New York or LA in it's loft structure and modernity. The lush and 'secret' garden is a treasure in the City, and the environment is a safe and wonderful place to explore, stimulate and inspire participants. The loft is full of eclectic art, comfortable furniture, colour, and fun.  It's a perfect place to collaborate and experience the spontaneous moments which enable us to be joyful and full of laughter.
